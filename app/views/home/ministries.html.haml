    %b Destiny School and Orphanage: Kampala, Uganda

  .block
    Bishop John-Michael Mugerwa (late) and his wife, Pastor Eva Mugerwa of Saints Gate Church in Katwe, Uganda founded the Destiny School and Orphanage in Kampala, Uganda, after raising many orphaned children in their own home.  They accepted parental responsibilities for numerous children who were orphaned by the AIDS epidemic.  Many of the young men and women they parented are now pastors of new churches.

  .block
    Prior to building Destiny, over 60 children slept in Saints Gate Church every night.  Located in the hillside outside of the city, Destiny School and Orphanage has grown to over 1,500 students who are cared for, taught the Word of God, and trained to become ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

  .block
    Set Free by Jesus Ministries has been in relationship with Saints Gate Church and Destiny School and Orphanage for over 12 years.  We participated with the construction of the very first building and also participate through financial support and hands-on ministry.  Apostles Charlie and Dr. Durinda have traveled to Uganda on many occasions to minister alongside of the late Bishop John-Michael and Pastor Eva.  They try to schedule a mission trip to Destiny annually as the Lord directs.  We gladly welcome all support to help finance our next mission trip to minister to our friends at Destiny.
