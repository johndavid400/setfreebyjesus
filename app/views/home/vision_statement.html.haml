Jesus is clarifying and lifting our Kingdom vision higher through His rhema words to us. For over 25 years, SFJM has reached out to those who are poor, infirm, or in physical or spiritual captivity. We have witnessed the overwhelming love of Jesus toward us and the demonstration of His love through miraculous healings, deliverances, and transformed lives.

Our purpose is to demonstrate that Jesus is Who He says He is and HE will do what He says He will do. Our strategies include the five-fold ministries of Pastor, (Set Free by Jesus Church), Evangelist (crusades), Prophet (Holy Spirit Soaking Meetings), Teacher (workshops), and Apostle (GOD-FAITH Encounters).

We believe that Jesus is assembling His Body (you and me) to arise and become His glorious Church. Jesus said that we will know that we are IN Him (John 14:20). As we choose to dwell IN Jesus, in His presence, we will access and operate in the faith OF GOD, or "GOD-FAITH"! (Mark 11:22). As five-fold ministers, we help equip the Church for her key role in this New Day of the Saints. Every believer has an important role in advancing the Kingdom. Let us co labor and possess our promised land by supernatural force, positioned IN Jesus and operating in GOD-FAITH!
